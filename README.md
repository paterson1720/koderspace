KoderSpace is a project that aims to provide a space where developer can share their knowledge by sharing snippets of code. 
 The stack we use is: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Node.js, MongoDB

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paterson1720/koderspace
````

install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
````

Next, look at the ``.env.sample`` and ``.env.local.sample`` files to see how to configure the environment variables

Once you have the .env and the .env.local files configured, run the dev server using this command:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) with your browser to see the app in action.
